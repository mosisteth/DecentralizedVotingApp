# Decentralized Voting Application

## Overview
This repository contains the code for a decentralized voting application built on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to leverage blockchain technology to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof electoral processes. This solution addresses common concerns in digital voting systems, such as fraud and lack of transparency, making elections more trustworthy and verifiable.

## Features
- **Secure Voting**: Utilizes Ethereum smart contracts to record votes securely on the blockchain.
- **Transparency**: Every vote is transparent and can be audited in real-time, maintaining voter anonymity.
- **Decentralization**: Removes the need for a central authority to manage elections, reducing potential points of failure.
- **Accessibility**: Provides a user-friendly interface for voters and administrators to interact with the voting system.

## Project Structure
- **SmartContracts/**: Contains the Solidity smart contracts that manage the election process, including `ElectionManager.sol` for handling the core voting logic.
- **FrontendComponents/**: Vue.js components for the application's frontend, including `ElectionResults.vue` for displaying real-time election results.
- `.travis.yml`: Configuration file for Travis CI for continuous integration.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose file to orchestrate the application's services for development and testing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) for compiling and deploying smart contracts
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) for a local Ethereum blockchain
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) for interacting with the Ethereum network

### Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mosisteth/DecentralizedVotingApp.git
1. Install dependencies:
cd DecentralizedVotingApp
npm install
2. Start Ganache and deploy the smart contracts:
truffle migrate --reset
3. Run the frontend application:
cd FrontendComponents
npm run serve
Usage

 • Voters will use the frontend application to cast their votes securely.
 • Election Administrators can set up elections, register candidates, and monitor election progress through the smart contracts.
